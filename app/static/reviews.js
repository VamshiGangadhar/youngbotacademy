    review:
      "Taking this robotics class has been one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. The teacher really knows how to break down complicated topics in a way that is less complex and more engaging. He’s always encouraging us to think critically and find solutions on our own, which has made me more confident in my problem-solving skills. The lessons are fun, and I’ve gained a deeper understanding of robotics and programming. I definitely feel more prepared for future challenges in tech thanks to this class!",

    review:
      "My son Arjun , 13 years, has been attending a Arduino class held by Mr.Srinivas. I had requested for a demo class in the beginning because Arjun wasn’t sure if Arduino would interest him. Arjun loved rte demo! He mentioned the class was very engaging and informative. Mr Srinivas was also very flexible with the class timings considering we live in US .What I love about that class is that Mr Srinivas first questions Arjun to know what his understanding about a certain topic was and then give additional information. The classes are not just one way instructions from Mr Srinivas . In addition, there are homework assignments given which a sense of accomplishment! Arjun built a sensor for homework and was showing around to his little brother! Arjun is keen to work with Mr.Srinivas and build a robot after this course is complete!!",
